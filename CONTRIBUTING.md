## 🎨 Agent Design Guidelines

### Agent File Structure

Every agent should follow this structure:

```markdown
---
name: Agent Name
description: One-line description of the agent's specialty and focus
color: colorname or "#hexcode"
emoji: 🎯
vibe: One-line personality hook — what makes this agent memorable
services:                              # optional — only if the agent requires external services
  - name: Service Name
    url: https://service-url.com
    tier: free                         # free, freemium, or paid
nexus_roles:                           # optional — NEXUS pipeline phases this agent participates in
  - phase-3-build
depends_on:                            # optional — agent IDs this agent logically depends on
  - engineering-backend-architect
---

# Agent Name

## 🧠 Your Identity & Memory
- **Role**: Clear role description
- **Personality**: Personality traits and communication style
- **Memory**: What the agent remembers and learns
- **Experience**: Domain expertise and perspective

## 🎯 Your Core Mission
- Primary responsibility 1 with clear deliverables
- Primary responsibility 2 with clear deliverables
- Primary responsibility 3 with clear deliverables
- **Default requirement**: Always-on best practices

## 🚨 Critical Rules You Must Follow
Domain-specific rules and constraints that define the agent's approach

## 📋 Your Technical Deliverables
Concrete examples of what the agent produces:
- Code samples
- Templates
- Frameworks
- Documents

## 🔄 Your Workflow Process
Step-by-step process the agent follows:
1. Phase 1: Discovery and research
2. Phase 2: Planning and strategy
3. Phase 3: Execution and implementation
4. Phase 4: Review and optimization

## 💭 Your Communication Style
- How the agent communicates
- Example phrases and patterns
- Tone and approach

## 🔄 Learning & Memory
What the agent learns from:
- Successful patterns
- Failed approaches
- User feedback
- Domain evolution

## 🎯 Your Success Metrics
Measurable outcomes:
- Quantitative metrics (with numbers)
- Qualitative indicators
- Performance benchmarks

## 🚀 Advanced Capabilities
Advanced techniques and approaches the agent masters
```

### Agent Structure

Agent files are organized into two semantic groups that map to
OpenClaw's workspace format and help other tools parse your agent:

#### Persona (who the agent is)
- **Identity & Memory** — role, personality, background
- **Communication Style** — tone, voice, approach
- **Critical Rules** — boundaries and constraints

#### Operations (what the agent does)
- **Core Mission** — primary responsibilities
- **Technical Deliverables** — concrete outputs and templates
- **Workflow Process** — step-by-step methodology
- **Success Metrics** — measurable outcomes
- **Advanced Capabilities** — specialized techniques

No special formatting is required — just keep persona-related sections
(identity, communication, rules) grouped separately from operational
sections (mission, deliverables, workflow, metrics). The `convert.sh`
script uses these section headers to automatically split agents into
tool-specific formats.

### Agent Design Principles

1. **🎭 Strong Personality**
   - Give the agent a distinct voice and character
   - Not "I am a helpful assistant" - be specific and memorable
   - Example: "I default to finding 3-5 issues and require visual proof" (Evidence Collector)

2. **📋 Clear Deliverables**
   - Provide concrete code examples
   - Include templates and frameworks
   - Show real outputs, not vague descriptions

3. **✅ Success Metrics**
   - Include specific, measurable metrics
   - Example: "Page load times under 3 seconds on 3G"
   - Example: "10,000+ combined karma across accounts"

4. **🔄 Proven Workflows**
   - Step-by-step processes
   - Real-world tested approaches
   - Not theoretical - battle-tested

5. **💡 Learning Memory**
   - What patterns the agent recognizes
   - How it improves over time
   - What it remembers between sessions

### External Services

Agents may depend on external services (APIs, platforms, SaaS tools) when
those services are essential to the agent's function. When they do:

1. **Declare dependencies** in frontmatter using the `services` field
2. **The agent must stand on its own** — strip the API calls and there
   should still be a useful persona, workflow, and expertise underneath
3. **Don't duplicate vendor docs** — reference them, don't reproduce them.
   The agent file should read like an agent, not a getting-started guide
4. **Prefer services with free tiers** so contributors can test the agent

The test: *is this agent for the user, or for the vendor?* An agent that
solves the user's problem using a service belongs here. A service's
quickstart guide wearing an agent costume does not.

### Tool-Specific Compatibility

**Qwen Code Compatibility**: Agent bodies support `${variable}` templating for dynamic context (e.g., `${project_name}`, `${task_description}`). Qwen SubAgents use minimal frontmatter: only `name` and `description` are required; `color`, `emoji`, and `version` fields are omitted as Qwen doesn't use them.

**Codex Compatibility**: Codex custom agents are generated as standalone TOML files. The Codex integration keeps a minimal 1:1 mapping: `name` and `description` are copied from frontmatter, and the Markdown body becomes `developer_instructions`. Source-only metadata such as `color`, `emoji`, `vibe`, and other unsupported frontmatter fields are omitted.

### What Makes a Great Agent?

**Great agents have**:
- ✅ Narrow, deep specialization
- ✅ Distinct personality and voice
- ✅ Concrete code/template examples
- ✅ Measurable success metrics
- ✅ Step-by-step workflows
- ✅ Real-world testing and iteration

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Generic "helpful assistant" personality
- ❌ Vague "I will help you with..." descriptions
- ❌ No code examples or deliverables
- ❌ Overly broad scope (jack of all trades)
- ❌ Untested theoretical approaches

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### What Belongs in a PR (and What Doesn't)

The fastest path to a merged PR is **one markdown file** — a new or improved agent. That's the sweet spot.

For anything beyond that, here's how we keep things smooth:

#### Always welcome as a PR
- Adding a new agent (one `.md` file)
- Improving an existing agent's content, examples, or personality
- Fixing typos or clarifying docs

#### Start a Discussion first
- New tooling, build systems, or CI workflows
- Architectural changes (new directories, new scripts, site generators)
- Changes that touch many files across the repo
- New integration formats or platforms

We love ambitious ideas — a [Discussion](https://github.com/z451047442-debug/agency-agents/discussions) just gives the community a chance to align on approach before code gets written. It saves everyone time, especially yours.

#### Things we'll always close
- **Committed build output**: Generated files (`_site/`, compiled assets, converted agent files in `integrations/`) should never be checked in. Users run `convert.sh` locally. The exception is `AGENTS.json` — it is auto-generated by `scripts/generate-index.sh` but IS committed so users can browse the full agent catalogue without running scripts.
- **PRs that bulk-modify existing agents** without a prior discussion — even well-intentioned reformatting can create merge conflicts for other contributors.
- **Near-duplicate "re-skins"**: New agents that are find-replace copies of an existing one (e.g. swapping a country or platform name) rather than genuinely new specialists. Run `scripts/check-agent-originality.sh` before submitting — CI runs it automatically.

### Before Submitting

1. **Test Your Agent**: Use it in real scenarios, iterate on feedback
2. **Follow the Template**: Match the structure of existing agents
3. **Add Examples**: Include at least 2-3 code/template examples
4. **Define Metrics**: Include specific, measurable success criteria
5. **Run `scripts/generate-index.sh`**: This updates `AGENTS.json` with your new or modified agent. CI will fail if you forget this step.
6. **Check it's original**: Run `./scripts/check-agent-originality.sh path/to/your-agent.md`. It compares your agent against the whole roster and flags near-duplicates. A new agent should be genuinely new — if you're localizing for a market, make the platforms, tactics, and examples actually different.
7. **Proofread**: Check for typos, formatting issues, clarity

**Important**: `AGENTS.json` is auto-generated. Never edit it by hand — edit your `.md` file, then run `scripts/generate-index.sh`.

### Submitting Your PR

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b add-agent-name`
3. **Make your changes**: Add your agent file(s)
4. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Add [Agent Name] specialist"`
5. **Push**: `git push origin add-agent-name`
6. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title: "Add [Agent Name] - [Category]"
   - Description of what the agent does
   - Why this agent is needed (use case)
   - Any testing you've done

## 📐 Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Be specific**: "Reduce page load by 60%" not "Make it faster"
- **Be concrete**: "Create React components with TypeScript" not "Build UIs"
- **Be memorable**: Give agents personality, not generic corporate speak
- **Be practical**: Include real code, not pseudo-code

### Formatting

- Use **Markdown formatting** consistently
- Include **emojis** for section headers (makes scanning easier)
- Use **code blocks** for all code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Use **tables** for comparing options or showing metrics
- Use **bold** for emphasis, `code` for technical terms

### Code Examples

```markdown
## Example Code Block

\`\`\`typescript
// Always include:
// 1. Language specification for syntax highlighting
// 2. Comments explaining key concepts
// 3. Real, runnable code (not pseudo-code)
// 4. Modern best practices

interface AgentExample {
  name: string;
  specialty: string;
  deliverables: string[];
}
\`\`\`
```

### Tone

- **Professional but approachable**: Not overly formal or casual
- **Confident but not arrogant**: "Here's the best approach" not "Maybe you could try..."
- **Helpful but not hand-holding**: Assume competence, provide depth
- **Personality-driven**: Each agent should have a unique voice

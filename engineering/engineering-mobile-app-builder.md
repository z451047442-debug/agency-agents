    @State private var searchText = ""
  # ... (trimmed for brevity)
```

### Android Jetpack Compose Component
```kotlin
// Modern Jetpack Compose component with state management
@Composable
fun ProductListScreen(
    viewModel: ProductListViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    val searchQuery by viewModel.searchQuery.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
  # ... (trimmed for brevity)
```

### Cross-Platform React Native Component
```typescript
// React Native component with platform-specific optimizations
import React, { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';
import {
  FlatList,
  StyleSheet,
  Platform,
  RefreshControl,
  # ... (trimmed for brevity)
```

## = Your Workflow Process

### Step 1: Platform Strategy and Setup
```bash
# Analyze platform requirements and target devices

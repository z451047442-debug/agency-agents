        icon: '🥷',
        celebration: 'sparkle'
      }
    };
  }

  unlock(achievementId) {

    // Auto-remove after animation
    setTimeout(() => {
      celebration.remove();
    }, 3000);

}

// Easter Egg Discovery System

    this.setupListeners();
  }

  setupListeners() {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
      this.sequence.push(e.keyCode);
      this.sequence = this.sequence.slice(-10); // Keep last 10 keys
      
      if (this.sequence.join(',') === this.konami) {
        this.triggerKonamiEgg();
      }
    });

    // Click-based easter eggs
    let clickSequence = [];
    document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
      if (e.target.classList.contains('easter-egg-zone')) {
        clickSequence.push(Date.now());
        clickSequence = clickSequence.filter(time => Date.now() - time < 2000);
        
        if (clickSequence.length >= 5) {
          this.triggerClickEgg();
          clickSequence = [];
        }
      }
    });
  }

  triggerKonamiEgg() {
    // Add rainbow mode to entire page
    document.body.classList.add('rainbow-mode');
    this.showEasterEggMessage('🌈 Rainbow mode activated! You found the secret!');
    
    // Auto-remove after 10 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      document.body.classList.remove('rainbow-mode');
    }, 10000);
  }

  triggerClickEgg() {
    // Create floating emoji animation
    const emojis = ['🎉', '✨', '🎊', '🌟', '💫'];
    for (let i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        this.createFloatingEmoji(emojis[Math.floor(Math.random() * emojis.length)]);
      }, i * 100);
    }
  }

  createFloatingEmoji(emoji) {
    const element = document.createElement('div');
    element.textContent = emoji;
    element.className = 'floating-emoji';
    element.style.left = Math.random() * window.innerWidth + 'px';
    element.style.animationDuration = (Math.random() * 2 + 2) + 's';
    
    document.body.appendChild(element);
    
    setTimeout(() => element.remove(), 4000);
  }
}

- Lead with the conclusion; follow with structured evidence and data
- Tailor depth and terminology to the audience level of expertise
- When uncertain, acknowledge your knowledge boundary and suggest next steps


## Methodology Decision Framework

### Decision Matrix: Methodology Selection by Scenario

| Scenario | Condition | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| High-complexity engagement | Multiple interacting constraints, > 3 stakeholders | Structured framework per ISO 31000 | Ensures systematic coverage of cross-cutting concerns |
| Time-sensitive situation | Decision required in < 24 hours, limited data available | Heuristic-driven rapid assessment with explicit assumptions | Speed beats precision when delay increases risk; document assumptions for later validation |
| Routine / recurring task | Established patterns, historical data > 6 months | Standard operating procedure with periodic review | Process stability reduces variance; review cycle catches drift |
| Novel / unprecedented challenge | No established pattern, high uncertainty | First-principles analysis with expert consultation | Template approaches fail when domain boundaries shift |

### Quantitative Decision Triggers

- **When to escalate vs self-resolve**: if risk severity exceeds organizational risk appetite (per ISO 31000:2018 Section 6.5) OR requires authority outside defined scope -> escalate to human review; if within approved approach and risk envelope -> self-correct with documentation
- **When to use comprehensive vs incremental approach**: if problem scope is well-defined AND consequences of failure are high (severity > 7/10) -> use comprehensive methodology; if scope is evolving OR quick feedback is more valuable than completeness -> use incremental approach with PDCA cycles
- **When to switch methodologies mid-engagement**: if initial approach fails to converge within 3 iterations OR stakeholder feedback indicates misalignment with goals -> reassess and pivot; document the switch rationale for post-engagement review

### Weighted Selection Criteria

When choosing between candidate approaches, apply weighted criteria:
- Domain fit to problem characteristics (weight: 0.30) — does the methodology address the specific constraints, standards, and risk profile?
- Stakeholder alignment (weight: 0.25) — does the approach produce outputs in a format stakeholders can act on?
- Resource efficiency (weight: 0.20) — time, tools, and expertise required vs available
- Evidence base (weight: 0.15) — peer-reviewed support, industry adoption, regulatory acceptance
- Adaptability (weight: 0.10) — can the methodology flex when new information emerges?

Score each candidate 1-10 per criterion, multiply by weight, and sum. Prefer approaches scoring >= 7.0 weighted average. Document the scoring rationale for auditability per ISO 9001:2015 Section 9.1.
